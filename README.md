In this project, I use Python to automate the getting of financial data by extracting the financial data from XBRL instance documents.

To view the project <code>Extract_financial_data_from_XBRL.ipynb</code>, click <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/steffen-zou/Extract-financial-data-from-XBRL/blob/master/Extract_financial_data_from_XBRL.ipynb">here</a> which will display the project using Jupyter Notebook Viewer, as GitHub sometimes is not able to load this project.

The `data_files` folder contains the XBRL instance documents that are used in this project.

The `stock_db_dump.sql` file is a PostgreSQL database backup that contains a table that this project insert/update records to. The command to restore the backup can be found in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/backup.html#BACKUP-DUMP-RESTORE">PostgreSQL documentation</a>.
